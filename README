This repository contains the code for exercise 1 : performance test. 

In order to run the executables as nodes, start the master and type in different shells (preferably only one publisher and one subscriber at the same time):
- rosrun performance_test publisher_node
- rosrun performance_test publisher_nodepy.py
- rosrun performance_test subscriber_node
- rosrun performance_test subscriber_nodepy.py

Publisher nodes publish a message at an increasing rate, starting at 0.1 Hz and incrementing in 0.1 Hz at every iteration.

Subscriber nodes compare the rate set by the pusblishers to the real one (computed by the subscribers). Subscribers show the message:
"Max rate: <rate_value> Hz"
(where "rate_value" corresponds to the value for the rate set at the publisher) the first time the difference between the rate set at the publisher and the real rate exceeds in 50% the value of the former.
